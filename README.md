## Introduction 🖍️

In the futuristic city of Aeropolis, autonomous delivery drones are revolutionizing the way goods are transported across the sprawling metropolis, ensuring fast and efficient delivery. These drones play a pivotal role in maintaining the city's dynamic pace, with their performance evaluated by the amount of cargo they can deliver per flight. However, optimizing drone performance is no simple task, as it depends on a multitude of factors, including weather conditions, flight altitude, terrain type, and other operational variables.

Therefore our project addresses the challenge of optimizing drone logistics in Aeropolis by predicting cargo capacity under diverse conditions, thereby improving delivery efficiency and resource utilization. By analyzing a rich dataset encompassing 20 variables, we seek to enhance drone performance, optimize resource allocation, and contribute to the development of smarter urban logistics solutions. 

Our approach is built around a structured data science workflow. We begin with an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights within the dataset. This phase includes visualizing trends, detecting anomalies, and identifying the most critical factors influencing drone performance. The insights gained here serve as the foundation for all subsequent steps in the analysis.

Next, we move to the data preprocessing phase, where the raw dataset is transformed into a format suitable for machine learning models. This includes handling missing values, scaling numerical variables, and encoding categorical features. These tailored preprocessing steps not only prepare the data for analysis but also help highlight hidden relationships that could enhance the predictive power of our models.

Finally, we embark on a detailed experimentation process, testing various machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective approach for predicting drone cargo capacity. Each model is carefully fine-tuned, and its performance is evaluated to ensure it meets the high standards required for Aeropolis’s dynamic delivery ecosystem. This iterative process ensures that our final model is both robust and accurate, ready to contribute to the optimization of Aeropolis’s autonomous delivery systems.

The results will enable Aeropolis to continue leading the way in futuristic logistics and urban innovation! 🥳

## Methods 🔎

Our project began with a thorough analysis of the Aeropolis dataset, employing Python and its powerful ecosystem of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This exploratory phase was essential for understanding the dataset’s unique characteristics, including the distribution of key variables and its structure. It has permitted to laid a strong foundation for predictive modeling.

### Dataset Analysis
The EDA started with a thorough examination of the dataset, focusing on understanding its structure, the distribution of variables, checked for anomalies, and any initial trends or patterns.

The Aeropolis dataset comprises 20 features that span environmental, operational, and logistical factors. Below is a preview of the dataset used in this project:

![Dataset Preview](images/dataset_preview.png "Dataset Preview")

Therefore it consists of:
- **Target Variable**: `Cargo_Capacity_kg` (continuous).
- **Features**: Numerical (e.g., `Flight_Hours`, `Vertical_Max_Speed`) and categorical (e.g., `Weather_Status`, `Package_Type`).

We've also focused on understanding the distribution of both numerical and categorical variables. These univariate analyses provided valuable insights, revealing multimodal distributions in some variables and skewed distributions in others. Additionally, this analysis informed our strategy for imputing missing values later in the data preprocessing pipeline.

### Identification of Anomalies
During the initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identified several anomalies within the dataset. 

One notable issue, as we've prevusly said, was that the feature Cleaning_Liquid_Usage_liters exhibited a significant right skew. This skewness led to an imbalance in the dataset, adversely impacting the performance of our models.

Additionally, our analysis revealed that features such as Cargo_Capacity_kg, Route_Optimization_Per_Second, and Water_Usage_liters contained negative values. These are logically implausible, as such variables can't assume negative values in real-world scenarios. To address this inconsistency, we decided to replace these erroneous values with NaN. This approach aligns with our data preprocessing pipeline, which includes systematic handling of missing values later in the workflow.

Lastly, the column Flight_Duration_Minutes was found to contain Boolean values, which is clearly incorrect since it should represent numerical data. Given that this column was not providing meaningful insights and was irreparably flawed, we decided to remove it from the dataset entirely.

### Filling Missing Data
We then checked for missing values in the dataset and visualized the results to conduct a thorough analysis. Our findings revealed that nearly 10% of all features contained missing values, which could pose significant challenges during model training.
# IMMAGE
At the beginning of our preprocessing, we attempted to fill missing values using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation method. While this algorithm is effective in many scenarios, it proved to be too slow for our dataset due to the large volume of missing values and the associated computational complexity.
Faced with this challenge, we sought an alternative solution. After examining the correlation of missing values across features, we concluded that the missing data appeared independently in each column. This observation indicates that the dataset follows a Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) pattern.
# IMMAGE
Based on this analysis, we decided to handle missing values by imputing numerical columns with their median and categorical columns with their mode. However, for the Cargo_Capacity_Column, which serves as the target variable, we opted not to apply imputation, as maintaining accuracy in this column is critical, we've just decided to erase all the missing values of this column.

### Preprocessing
**Feature Encoding**:
Applied one-hot encoding for categorical features such as `Weather_Status` and `Terrain_Type`.
